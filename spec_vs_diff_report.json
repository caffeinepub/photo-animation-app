  "summary": "Both REQ-27 and REQ-28 appear to be substantially implemented. VideoResultScreen.tsx has been redesigned with a cinematic multi-layered preview including letterbox bars, color-grading gradients, film grain, scan-line, focus-pulse, HD badge, and 'Your Video is Ready' heading with glow effect. index.css defines the four new keyframe animations, and tailwind.config.js registers them under theme.extend.keyframes and theme.extend.animation. Minor truncation prevents full verification of exact animation timing values in index.css, but the file summaries and tailwind.config.js content confirm all four animations are present with correct durations.",

      "description": "An 'AI RENDER' badge and quality/duration badges are added to the video preview area, which were not requested in REQ-27 (only an 'HD' or resolution badge in the corner was specified).",
      "reason": "The build request only asked for an 'HD' or resolution badge. The diff summary and VideoResultScreen.tsx description mention 'AI RENDER badge, quality/duration badges' — these extra badges go beyond what was requested.",
