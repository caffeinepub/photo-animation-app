Replace the current simple shimmer/gradient placeholder with a rich, film-quality animated preview that includes: a deep black letterboxed frame with subtle film grain texture overlay, a multi-layered animated gradient simulating real video color grading (warm highlights, cool shadows), a realistic scan-line or light-leak animation pass, a subtle camera-focus pulse effect, and a 'HD' or resolution badge in the corner. The heading text above the preview should read 'Your Video is Ready' with a cinematic glow effect.",

      "text": "Add CSS keyframe animations in the global stylesheet to support the realistic video preview effect: define a 'filmGrain' animation that randomly shifts a noise-like background, a 'colorGrade' animation that smoothly transitions through cinematic color tones (teal shadows → warm highlights), a 'scanLine' animation that moves a semi-transparent horizontal bar top to bottom, and a 'focusPulse' animation that subtly scales the preview between 1.0 and 1.003 to simulate camera breathing. Register these animations in tailwind.config.js so they can be applied as Tailwind utility classes.",
