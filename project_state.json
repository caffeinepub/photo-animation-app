Users can enter text or upload an image, choose a style (cartoon, anime, cinematic, 3D effect), select video duration (5s, 10s, 15s), choose video quality (720p, 1080p), add background music, and download or share the generated video. AI improves simple prompts into professional ones. The app is fully free to use without login, with all features unlocked including 1080p. Generated video previews should look realistic.",
